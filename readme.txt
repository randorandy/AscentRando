Ascent Randomizer

Website roller is working (not m/m or the logic check boxes though)
Now able to return to zone 1 from zone 2 if desired

Cloned from Vitality to keep that functionality for later, but not all features are working, namely:
-casual logic
-m/m split
-logic considering that you can't return to zone 2 after leaving (seeds may not be beatable)
